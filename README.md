## C-Binary Trees

C Binary Trees are data structures used to store and retrieve data in an efficient manner. They are composed of nodes that contain data, as well as links that point to other nodes in the tree. C Binary Trees are a type of binary search tree, meaning that each node has two children, a left side and a right side.

C Binary Trees can be used to store and retrieve data in a variety of ways. One common use is to store a sorted list of data. By traversing the tree and comparing values, the tree can be used to quickly find a given value. This makes the tree an efficient data structure for sorting and retrieving data.
